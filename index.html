		<h1>Floral Feelings</h1>
		<div class="floralfeelings">

		</div>
		<p>Floral Feelings is an application prototype that monitors the users emotions. The application represents users input by creating a petal that coordinates to the emotion and is sized by the extent the user is feeling that emotion on a scale of 1-10.
			The petals are displayed radially around a circle based on the current time. Previous days are recorded for the user so that trends in emotions can be recorded for the user. When certain emotions reach past a certain range, the user can create notifications
			that suggest activities to help reduce negative emotions.</p>

		<h1>Frack the Game</h1>

			<img src="images/gamescreen.jpg" width="700"  alt="Game Screen" /></br>
			<img src="images/earthquakes.jpg" width="700"  alt="Event Card" /></br>
		</div>

		<p>Frack is an educational, multiplayer game meant to teach people about fracking. I collaborated with a team of Computer Scientists to make graphics that would work with the game's coding and function. I had creative freedom with the visuals for the game,
			so I decided to go in the direction of a dark, apocalyptic theme.</p>

		</div>

		<p>Reckless is a local board shop that needed some advertisements to be mailed out. The company did not have a logo so I created something to show for the flyer. I was told to have fun experimenting with the design and this was the final result that the
			client was happy with.</p>

		</div>
		<p>To advertise for the SAA event, Pajamarino!, I was given the task to design a Snapchat filter. The tradition of this event is that students arrive at the train station and greet alumni in their pajamas. I tried to make a filter that incorporated these
			two aspects in a fun way. The filter was viewed over 15,000 times and shared over 200 times.</p>
